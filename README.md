# MR_Audit_Tool

Application to take in an export of data and returns all trips that are payable. It returns the trips that could be payable if the data is fixed. Has to use an export since no API is available for the data management software we use. Uses python for the backing and qt pyside6 for the front end. 

Used pyinstaller to package the application.
